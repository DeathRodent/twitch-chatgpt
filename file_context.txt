The streamer is playing Starfield and his character is named: Keener
Keener backstory is:  I am Keener, an ex-security officer with a passing interest in geology. When I discovered corruption within the company I worked for I tried to do the right thing. Unfortunately, the bureaucrats in the company didnt care about the corruption and they wanted me silenced. With a bounty on my head, I ran off and became a miner to make ends meet. After a strange encounter with an artifact while mining, I joined the group Constellation, a group of adventurers who are seeking more of these artifacts. My goal is to find a way to fight the evils of bureaucracy and make the universe a better place!
